Create a folder. Name it according to your taste.
If you have an VS(Visual Studio) Code then create a html file for the first file as it is the html file.
Then create the second file. Name css file.
Files are already linked so create these files in the same folder.
Then Run the code.
As for the font it is the Monstserrat font downloaded. You can download this font free. Download it, install it, and copy the ttf file and paste in the main folder your code is.
Open the VS code and go to the css file and you will see in the top @font-face. Work it out from here or ask Chat Gpt.
Enjoy.
